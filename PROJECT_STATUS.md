# CineMetrics — Project Status

**Current Status:** *Paused*

## Overview

CineMetrics started as an exploratory analytics platform focused on data pipelines, financial analysis, and insight generation in the movie entertainment domain.

The project was intentionally used to explore:

- Data ingestion and validation pipelines  
- Analytics and ROI modeling  
- Database design and relational data modeling  
- CI/CD pipelines and professional Python workflows  

## Current State

During development, it became clear that the platform would benefit from a stronger user-centered redesign to better define its scope and primary use case.

For that reason, the project is currently paused while focus shifts to more product-driven, user-focused applications.

## Why This Repository Remains Public

This repository remains public as a demonstration of:

- Backend and data engineering practices  
- Analytical thinking and metric design  
- Code quality, testing, and CI/CD workflows
